# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# weathers = Weather.create([
#     {name: 'Freezing', temperature: '0-32 degrees'},
#     {name: 'Freezing/Rainy' }, 

#     {name: 'Cold', temperature: '33-50 degrees' }, 
#     {name: 'Cold/Rainy' }, 
#     {name: 'Cold/Snowing' }, 

#     {name: 'Cool', temperature: '51-69 degrees' }, 
#     {name: 'Cool/Rainy' }, 

#     {name: 'Warm', temperature: '70-80 degrees' }, 
#     {name: 'Warm/Rainy' }, 

#     {name: 'Hot', temperature: '81-95 degrees' },
#     {name: 'Hot/Rainy' },

#     {name: 'Scorching', temperature: '96-120 degrees' }])
